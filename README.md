# Full FiroPOW verification algorithm implementation 

The FIROPOW is a PROGPOW variant(basic PROGPOW with a twist). The twist happens when the change   

What progpow does is that it fixes the efficiency gap available to the fixed function software

Added sequence of random math instructions and random cache reads that are merged into a much larger mixed state
KISS 99 calculations
-TODOs
1. Build a ProgPoW package
   To build the progpow package: There exist a seed by scanning through the block headers up until that point
   From the seed one can compute 16mb pseudorandom cache Light client store the cache
   From the dataset we can generate the 2gb dataset with the property the each item from the cache. Full clients and miners store the dataset.The dataset grows linearly with time
   The first bytes of the dag acts also 16kb cache set with 
   
2. Make appropriate twist and tune init FiroPoW
3. Make appropriate tuning of the values
4. Testing (Build a simple blockchain)
